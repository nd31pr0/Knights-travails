# Knights Travails

## Project Overview
"Knights Travails" is a JavaScript project that implements a function to find the shortest path a knight can take on a standard 8x8 chessboard. Using graph traversal algorithms, specifically Breadth-First Search (BFS), the program outputs all the squares the knight visits along its journey from a starting position to a target position.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard.
- Outputs the full path taken, including the number of moves.
- Ensures all moves remain within the bounds of the chessboard.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have a JavaScript environment set up. You can run the code in any modern web browser's console or use Node.js.

### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Node.js (optional, for running outside the browser)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open your browser's console or use a Node.js environment.
3. Copy and paste the `knightMoves` function into the console.
4. Call the function with the desired starting and ending positions.

### Example
```javascript
knightMoves([0, 0], [7, 7]);
